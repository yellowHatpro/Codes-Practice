/* Disjoint Set Union
# Cluster based problems: Have some elements and we need to add them into different groups/clusters and we might also want to check for any element that which group it belongs to..
-> Two kinds of operations : 
1. Union -> U(a,b)-> add element b to the group of a.
2. get(x) -> to which group x belongs to.

How to define identity of a group?
-> We define the leader/parent of the group , we pick any one element and mark it the leader.
